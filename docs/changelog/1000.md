- Deprecated vertex normals in the `vertexCallback()` of the python actions. preCICE will pass `None` if the normal parameter is defined.
- Deprecated the `flip-normals` attribute of meshes. This is not functional anymore.
- Removed vertex normals from the vtk exporters.
- Changed edge and triangle normals to be computed on-demand.
- Improved mesh memory usage of vertices by ~41% and of connectivity by ~55%.
