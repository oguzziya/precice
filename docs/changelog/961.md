- Added convergence information for linear solvers of PETSc-based RBF mappings. Reports of converged solvers are logged as DEBUG, stopped solvers as WARNING and diverged solvers as ERROR messages.
- Changed linear solvers of PETSc-based RBF mappings now issue a warning when they reach the maximum iterations. This used to result in am ERROR.
